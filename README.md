# Ankit Kumar  
### AI / ML Engineer | NLP & Production ML Systems

I build explainable AI systems focused on semantic understanding, hybrid scoring architectures, and production-oriented machine learning pipelines.

My work centers around:
- Transformer-based NLP systems
- Embedding similarity & ranking engines
- Structured feature + deep learning hybrid models
- FastAPI backend architectures
- Interactive ML dashboards

Currently focused on designing modular AI systems that bridge research concepts with deployable applications.
